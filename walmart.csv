I have never had any issues with the walmart here in my city and shop very regularly. Today was the first and hopefully last incident such as this one. It has everything to do with racial profiling. I have voiced my concerns to the manager on duty at the time and was told to contact corporate to file a complaint. I feel if this happened to myself as long as ive lived here and as regularly as I shop at walmart, it will happen to anyone else and for that reason as well.  I am writing today. I was followed by 3 different associates this evening. Literally from isle to isle, I have footage to back up my complaint as well. It was as if every move I made they were never too fsr behind. I do not appreciate that one bit. I have never felt so enraged and disgusted with the ignorance as I did today. I did nothing wrong yet i felt as if I was in the wrong for continuing to shop. From the clearance to the prosuce isle I was followed and watched as if I was some sort of criminal. It was so terrible I left. I have not felt more disgusted and angry as I did today and    I feel.it was entirely wrong of this individual to single anyone out due to. The color of their skin. and im writing to raise awareness to the issue at hand and possibly prevent someone else from having to deal with this very thing. At least at my local walmart. This has to end. It will never end completely but it is a start and it only takes 1. 1 Voice. 1 person to stand up for what is morally right. It is not going to happen overnight. Its inevitable to end all racism worldwide but this is something that cannot be brushed off and forgotten. For some this happens daily. It is never right and I will be that 1 person that might possibly save another from having to endure this terrible crime that is committed daily. This has to end. It starts with us.

They never seem to have an employee on duty there and even when you call for someone to show up, they never do. Last experience I had with the fabric cutting section, I was waiting for an employee to show up after I had pressed the help button. I heard them call over the intercom for someone to be sent and nobody showed up for about 10 minutes. I pressed the button again and while I was doing so, another customer showed up for the same thing. I was talking to the other customer about how long it was talking and they told me that the last time they were there, they waited for 30 minutes for someone to show up. However, nobody ever showed so they ended up cutting the fabric themselves and whenever they took it to the front they just put a price tag on it. I didn't think that was okay and I was in a rush and wasn't going to wait for 30 minutes to not get somebody to show up. So, since I know somebody who works there I called them and asked them if they could get someone down there. Within the next 5 minutes they had 2 people go down there and help me and other customers that needed fabric cut. When I told another person that I know who works there, they told me that usually the managers will ignore the calls for that section and customers tend to bring their fabric up there cut and no tags.""",,"What I love most about Walmart would have to be that I can do most of my shopping there and don't have to go anywhere else for the things I'm looking for.
